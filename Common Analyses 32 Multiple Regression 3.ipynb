    "# Multiple Regression Including Interaction Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When fitting a multiple regression model we are assessing whether scores on a scale dependent variable (DV) can be predicted from scores on several independent variables (IVs). We extend the linear regression equation by adding a new term for each IV. We can include each IV in the model separately but we may also believe that two (or more) of our IVs interact in some meaningful way that influences their relationship to the DV.\n",
    "\n",
    "When running multiple regression analyses using the statsmodels software package there are a couple of different ways to include interaction terms in the regression model. In this notebook I will demonstrate how to conduct a multiple regression analysis that includes the interaction between two of the IVs as an additional term in the model."

Note that using the formula specification as above we get a coefficient for age individually (the main effect of age), a coefficient for bmi individually (the main effect of bmi) and a coefficient for the interaction between age and bmi (age:bmi). In this case we can see that although individually age and bmi are signficant contributors to the model, there is no significant interaction between these variables when predicting scores on the DV (expenses). In relation to this dataset, this would tell us that there is no relationship between bmi and age that influences insurance expenses. Although it is the case that expenses increase with age and expenses increase with increasing bmi. It is not the case that bmi is related to age and in that in combination they can be used to predict insurance expenses. I will now run the model again and remove the individual main effects terms and just include the interaction. "

When using the multiplicative specification, the model that is fitted includes each variable individualy and the interaction term. So, although we didn't specify the individual IVs in the formula the model returned is the full model containing main effects and interactions. If we were looking at a three-way interaction (e.g. age * bmi * region) then specifiying the IVs as an interaction, in a way similar to model 4, would return a results summary containing the main effect of each IV and all two-way and the three-way combination of the IVs. When including interaction terms, it is worth noting that these can be specified for any number of variables (e.g. age * bmi * region * sex * IV5) but interpreting the meaning of such complex interaction terms can be very difficult and I would suggest that there should be good theoretical reasons for including anything beyond the interaction between two IVs in the model.

When this is the only IV term included in the model, then the interaction is the only predictor that will be fitted. The second is the multiplicative method, where variables names are separated by an asterisk, signifiying multiplication (IV1 * IV2). When this is the only IV term included in the model, then the output returned will included main effects and interaction terms for all variables named in the interaction. "
