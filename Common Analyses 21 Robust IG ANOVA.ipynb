    "# Robust Independent Groups ANOVA \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook I will demonstrate how to conduct a robust independent groups ANOVA. This will include testing for homogeneity of variance using Levene's test, conducting a Welch's ANOVA test in the case of a signficant Levene's test where equal variances cannot be assumed, and following this up with robust post-hoc tests using Games-Howell pairwise comparisons. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset that I will be using contains the responses of 152 police officers to a large questionnaire study investigating the topic of stress in the police force. I will conduct a one-way robust ANOVA on an independent variable (IV) of length of service. This variable records an officer's length of service and has been transformed into a categorical variable by binning length of service into three groups: Group 1: up to 10 years service, Group 2: 10 - 20 years service, Group 3: Over 20 years service. The dependent variable (DV) is a likert scale variable recording participants mean scores on a 7 item, 5 pt (0-4) likert scales measuring operational uplifts. This was a measure of a series of operational factors and whether they were rated positively or negatively over the previous month of service. \n"
