# Common Statistical Data Analyses in Python 

## An introduction tutorial on running common frequentist statistical analyses using Python

Rob Spencer is a Lecturer in the Psychology Department at Middlesex University, London. He is a behavioural scientist specialising in quantitative research methods and data analysis.

## Description

This repository was created to host the jupyter notebooks and some of the data files used in an associated video playlist on my youtube channel. The relevant playlist is titled Common Analyses. The purpose of that series of youtube videos is to provide a tutorial resource for colleagues and students who may be familiar with running the most common types of analysis used in classical (frequentist) statistics using GUI software interfaces but would like to learn, or try these analyses out, using Python. In these notebooks and the linked video series I demonstrate how to get started using the Anaconda distribution, create sandboxed environments for different projects, launch jupyter notebooks and use them to provide a structured and annotated record of the analyses you perform. Next, I cover how to wrangle and tidy your data so it is in the appropriate format for analysis using Pandas and Numpy; then I visualise and explore data using Matplotlib and Seaborn. Finally, I demonstrate how to conduct various classical statistical analyses, such as Student T-tests, correlation, Chi-Square, ANOVA, and regression, on different datasets using Python libraries such as Scipy, statsmodels, pingouin, and Scikit-learn. 

In the notebooks, and youtube videos, I have collected together materials and information that I used to teach myself how to use Python to conduct data analysis. In many cases there may be different, better, or more pythonic ways to wrangle and analyse the data that that used. Rather than going for perfection I have focused on finding solutions that worked and were useful for presenting and interpreting the results of the analysis. This meant searching through documentation and material posted online by other people who have tried to solve similar data analysis problems. Where I have found a youtube channel or resource particularly helpful I have put a link in the acknowledgments section below so people can explore those sites for themselves. I hope these notebooks (and videos) are of value and help you get started   

The target audience for this tutorial series includes new Python users who have some background in introductory statistics and data analysis. 

## User Instructions

Users familiar with git, may simply clone this repository to obtain the materials (Jupyter notebooks and data files). Alternatively you may download individual files or simply view the static notebooks by clicking on them. Please note, I have only included data files on this repository from my own research. I use a number of other data files in the videos for demonstration and instructional purposes, many of these files are readily available online as open source material, or are contained within software libraries as sample datasets, and can be easily found with a quick google search. To get the most out of this tutorial content run these notebooks in conjunction with watching the youtube video series.
