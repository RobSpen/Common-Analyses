    "ANOVA allows us to compare the differences between multiple group means on some scale dependent variable whilst controlling for the family-wise error rate. Repeated Measures (or within-subjects) ANOVA allows us to compare multiple groups when the scores within those groups all come from the same participants recorded at different time points.  "

    "In this notebook I will demonstrate how to run a one-way repeated measures ANOVA using the AnovaRM method from the statsmodels library. This is a design with one independent variable(IV), with 3 groups, and a scale dependent variable (DV). \n",
    "\n",
    "An important thing to note when running this analysis is that a participant/ subject identification number variable (column) is needed to that the structure that exists in the data from the fact that participants contribute multiple datapoints can be taken into account. To make the analysis easier to run it is helpful to have the data in a 'long and thin' format with the DV measure contained in one variable (column) rather than spread over multiple columns, and have a second variable with multiple levels for the grouping (IV) variable.
